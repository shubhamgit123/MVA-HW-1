## Dataset for Analyzing News Website Traffic and Revenue

Questions that I want to be answered with this dataset

<b>How does the average session duration vary across different devices (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet) during different times of the day, and does this variation correlate with the conversion rate?</b>

<p>

1.  Understanding the relationship between average session duration, device categories, and conversion rates can provide valuable insights into user behavior and the effectiveness of marketing efforts. 

2.  Identifying the average session duration on different devices helps in tailoring the website or app experience based on the preferred device of the users.

3.By analyzing these metrics across different times of the day, you can identify peak performance periods and allocate resources for marketing campaigns or website maintenance accordingly.

<b>Does the type of material and length of session have a meaningful relationship?</b>

<p>

1.  Examining the correlation between content categories and session duration can help identify areas of a website where visitors rapidly become disinterested and leave. Enhancing the user experience, layout, or caliber of material within particular categories is made possible by this.

2.  By focusing on subjects that pique users' interest and maintain their attention for extended periods of time, we can ensure that our content creation efforts are guided by this information.

</p>

<b>When does the biggest number of sessions and conversions occur across various traffic sources during the day?</b>

<p>

1.  By pinpointing the peak traffic periods for each traffic source, we      can optimize your website and its assets, including scheduling ad         campaigns and content, as well as enhancing the website's        responsiveness and loading speed.

2.  We are able to make data-driven decisions that enhance user experience and optimize resource allocation when we comprehend the relationship between website performance, traffic source, and time of day.
